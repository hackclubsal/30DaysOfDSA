## Q.16) Given a set of n integers denoting the strength of each student participating in a tug of war, divide the students into 2 equal parts such that the difference between the strengths of both the groups is minimum. Return the difference between the strengths of both the groups.

Note: If the number of students is odd, one group will have an extra student.

Examples-1:

- Input:

strengths: [1, 2, 3, 4]

group 1: [1, 4] ,group 2: [2, 3]


- Output:
difference: 0


Example-2:

- Input:

strengths: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

group 1: [1, 2, 5], group 2: [3, 4]


- Output:
difference: 1
