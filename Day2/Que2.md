## Given an array, *rotate the array* to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

For Example,

``Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] , k = 3``

``Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]``
 
Explanation:
- rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6] 
- rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
- rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
