## Given a matrix, check if the matrix contains a given key.

The matrix has the following properties:

Integer in each row is arranged in non-decreasing order from left to right.
The first integer in every row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log (n*m))

Examples:

` Matrix`:
 - ` [1 2 3`
  - `4 5 6`
 -    `7 8 9]`

` Input Key: 6`

`Output: Answer - true`
