## Q.13) Given a directed graph. The task is to do Breadth First Traversal of this graph starting from 0.

- Input:
See the picture 

- Output: 0 1 2 3 4

Explanation: 

0 is connected to 1 , 2 , 3.

2 is connected to 4.so starting from 0, 

it will go to 1 then 2 then 3.

After this 2 to 4, 

thus bfs will be 0 1 2 3 4.
