## Q.12) Given an array of integers and a number K. Find the count of distinct elements in every window of size K in the array.

Example 1:

- Input: N = 7, K = 4
A[] = {1,2,1,3,4,2,3}
- Output: 3 4 4 3

Explanation: 

Window 1 of size k = 4 is 1 2 1 3. 
Number of distinct elements in this window are 3. 
Window 2 of size k = 4 is 2 1 3 4. 
Number of distinct elements in this window are 4.
Window 3 of size k = 4 is 1 3 4 2. 
Number of distinct elements in this window are 4.
Window 4 of size k = 4 is 3 4 2 3. 
Number of distinct elements in this window are 3.

Example 2:

- Input: N = 3, K = 2*
A[] = {4,1,1}
- Output: 2 1
