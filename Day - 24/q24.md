## Q.24) A restaurant listing website has asked you to analyse the reviews on its restaurants.
## The reviews need to be sorted by how good they are, the best reviews go on top. The goodness a review is determined by the number of times "good words" appear in them. You are given a list of good words.

Given n reviews and m good words, sort the reviews, such that the one with most good words appears first. For reviews with the same number of good words, maintain the initial order.

Example:

- Input:

- Reviews: ["good restaurant", "tasty food nice ambience", "nice place"]

- Good Words: ["good", "lovely", "nice", "tasty"]

- Output:

- ["tasty food nice ambience", "good restaurant", "nice place"]
